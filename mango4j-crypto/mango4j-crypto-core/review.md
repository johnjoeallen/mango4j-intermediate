# Code and security review

Static review of all production Java classes and the module POM, with each finding checked against the code. Findings marked *reproduced* were also demonstrated by running the code. Dependencies were not scanned for known vulnerabilities.

**Quality gates:** mutation 99% (165/167), line coverage 99%; PIT thresholds are set to 98/99.

## Findings

1. **Decryption takes its cipher parameters from the stored ciphertext** (High). `PBKDF2EncryptionService.decrypt` builds the cipher from the algorithm, mode and padding in the container (`:162`) and the key size, iteration count and GCM tag length from it (`:151`); `CachedWrappedKeyEncryptionService.decrypt` and `WrappedKeyEncryptionService.decrypt` do the same through `CipherConfig.of(EncryptedDataConfig)`. Anyone who can write stored ciphertext can change a GCM record to `CBC`, which has no authentication, and the library will decrypt it. Take mode, algorithm, padding and tag length from the trusted `CryptoKey` configuration and reject a container that disagrees.

2. **CBC is accepted for encryption and carries no authentication** (High). `CipherManager.java:42` supports `CBC`, and the PBKDF2 and wrapped-key services (`PBKDF2EncryptionService.encrypt`, `WrappedKeyEncryptionService.encrypt`) store only IV and ciphertext with no MAC. Altered ciphertext can decrypt to altered plaintext, and padding errors can form a padding oracle if the caller exposes the outcome. Restrict new encryption to an authenticated mode and plan a migration for existing CBC data.

3. **The ciphertext controls the PBKDF2 work factor** (Medium). `PBKDF2EncryptionService.java:151-157` reads `iterations` and `keySize` from the container and passes them straight to PBKDF2 before anything is authenticated. A very large iteration count in a stored or submitted container ties up CPU. Bound the values against the trusted key configuration before deriving.

4. **The current data key is shared across key configurations** (Medium). `CachedWrappedKeyEncryptionService.java:58` uses one static cache, and `getCurrentWrappedKeyHolder` (`:191`) returns its current holder without looking at the supplied key configuration. Encrypting under a second wrapping key or key size can reuse a data key wrapped under the first (and of the first's size). Key the current holder by the configuration.

5. **`InMemoryKeyVault` does not protect keys from a memory dump** (Medium). `InMemoryKeyVault.java:67` stores the AES vault key in the same `VaultEntry` as the IV and the ciphertext it protects, so anyone who can read the heap can decrypt every stored key. It hides keys from casual inspection only; document it that way, or hold the vault key outside the process. (`get` also throws a bare `RuntimeException` at `:88` instead of the module's crypto exception.)

6. **HMAC computation re-derives the PBKDF2 key for every holder** (Medium). `PBKDF2EncryptionService.java:189` derives the key inside the per-holder loop with the full iteration count, although passphrase, salt and iterations are the same for a given key. An entity with many HMAC fields multiplies the cost. Derive once per key and reuse it.

7. **A global lock is held across remote key operations** (Medium). `CachedWrappedKeyEncryptionService.getCurrentWrappedKeyHolder` (`:191`) and `getWrappedKeyHolder` (`:285`) synchronise on the static cache while calling `encryptionService.encrypt/decrypt`, which for a KMS-backed wrapping key is a network call. Every thread that needs a data key waits behind a slow unwrap. Use per-key loading or a lock-free cache.

8. **Insecure algorithms and test delegates are available to production configuration** (Medium). `Algorithm.java:21` offers `DES` and `DESede`, `EncryptionService.java:60` registers every delegate it is given with `put` (a duplicate key type silently replaces the earlier delegate), and `IdentityEncryptionService` and `Base64EncryptionService` are in the main source set and perform no encryption. A mistaken registration or configuration weakens protection with no warning. Remove the test delegates from the shipped artifact, reject duplicates, and drop the weak algorithms.

9. **Key bytes are not wiped on error paths** (Low). `CachedWrappedKeyEncryptionService.java:141,271` zero the copied key only after a successful cipher operation, and the cache-miss decrypt path (`:295`) never zeroes `decodedKey` after the holder copies it into the vault. `PBEKeySpec` and the derived bytes in `PBKDF2EncryptionService.java:285` are never cleared. Wipe in `finally`.

10. **Static state is created and reconfigured at class-load and construction time** (Low). `CachedWrappedKeyEncryptionService.java:64` creates a non-daemon `ScheduledExecutorService` that is never shut down (it can keep the JVM alive and pin the class loader), and each constructor (`:89`) overwrites the TTLs of the one shared cache for all instances.

11. **Malformed ciphertext does not always produce the formatter exception** (Low). `CiphertextFormatter.java:41` dereferences `jsonNode.get("cryptoKeyId")` without a null check and catches only `JacksonException`, so a missing member or a null root escapes as `NullPointerException`.

## Notes

- All randomness (IVs, data keys, vault IVs) comes from a `SecureRandom`; there is no use of `java.util.Random`, MD5, SHA-1 or ECB, and HMAC uses HmacSHA256.
- The passphrase is held as a `String` in the key configuration and cannot be wiped.
- Security properties also depend on caller configuration and on the external key providers.
